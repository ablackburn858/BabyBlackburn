    <p class="implant-text">September 2nd was the big day. Implantation day. Sarah and I were so anxious. (But somehow along the way, I found inner-peace) It's been a long 2 years leading up to this moment. Which is easy for me to say. Unlike Sarah, I haven't had to work two jobs, drive up to doctor's appointments seemingly every other day, and inject myself with medications the way normal people take vitamins. I could never pay Sarah back for everything she sacrificed to make this happen. But, luckily she is ready to sacrific whatever it takes to bring Baby Blackburn to this world. The whole process only took about 30 minutes but it was years in the making for us.</p>
    <p class="implant-text">But, now we wait again. We are supposed to wait 9 days before Sarah takes a pregnancy test. </p>
